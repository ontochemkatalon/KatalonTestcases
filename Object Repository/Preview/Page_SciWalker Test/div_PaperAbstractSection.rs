Metallic nanoparticles are useful materials to be applied in biomedical research. In this study, the possible apoptotic and anti-metastatic activity of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles (ZnONPs) was assessed in breast cancer cells.
Methods:
First, in vitro cell viability was investigated by MTT assay in two human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and T47D) and normal Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells at 37°C overnight. Apoptosis induced by ZnONPs was evaluated by annexin V/PI staining, cell cycle analysis and caspase assay in cancerous cells. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR was employed for the detection of two metastasis suppressor genes (KAI-1 and NM23) expression in cancerous cells.
Results:
Data demonstrated that ZnONPs exert a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the viability of T47D and MCF-7 cells, while no cytotoxic effect was observed on normal HEK293 cells. The mRNA expression levels of KAI-1 and non-metastatic protein (NM23) genes were up-regulated in ZnONP-exposed cancerous cells. ZnONPs were also found to enhance the apoptosis properties of cells by annexin V/PI staining, and caspase assay in cancerous cells. Furthermore, ZnONPs can increase sub-G1 population as compared to negative control.
Conclusion:
Our findings showed that ZnONPs induce apoptotic activity and can modulate metastasis by up-regulating of KAI-1 and NM23 gene expression in two breast cancer (MCF-7 and T47D) cells.' or . = 'Evaluation of Metastasis Suppressor Genes Expression and In Vitro Anti-Cancer Effects of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles in Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines MCF-7 and T47DSeyed Ataollah Sadat Shandiz, Faryad Sharifian, Sorayya Behboodi, Fatemeh Ghodratpour, Fahimeh Baghbani-Arani2021, Avicenna Journal of Medical BiotechnologyBookmarkIn collections:noneNewAbstractMethodsBackground:
